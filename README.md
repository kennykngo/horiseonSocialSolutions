This project is a simple change of semantics, structure, and ordering of the HTML as well as CSS code. I've edited the header to be a nav instead since I would consider it a nav bar instead of a footer. 

```
<nav> </nav> 
```

## Edits
* HTML semantics, and CSS to match it
* Added 'alt's onto images so that when the image takes too long to load, there would be text indicating what it should look like
* Ordered and structured the code to be nested properly

### Example

```
<img 
  src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png"
  alt="lead-generation-image"
/>
```

## Challenge
The biggest challenge that this project presented was finding what needed to be structured and edited. 
I've noticed a few unnecessary ID's long after having changed the structure. In addition, a few tags were nested incorrectly. 
However, after having changed all of the tags, I've attempted to save and everything was thrown off. 

So I've changed the following code from 'true' to 'false'.

``` 
"editor.formatOnSave": false,
```
